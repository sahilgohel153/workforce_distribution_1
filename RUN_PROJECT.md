# 🚀 How to Run Workforce Distribution.ai - Complete Beginner Guide

## 📋 What You Need First

1. **Python** - Download and install Python 3.8 or higher from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. **Git** (optional) - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt/Terminal

- **Mac**: Open Terminal from Applications > Utilities
- **Linux**: Open Terminal

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\Intel Proj"
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (Python 3.12 Fix)
```bash
python fix_python312.py
```

**OR** if the above doesn't work, try this manual approach:
```bash
